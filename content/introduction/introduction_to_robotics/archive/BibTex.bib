Abstract = {In this work a graph-based, semantic mapping approach for indoor robotics applications is presented, which is extending OpenStreetMap (OSM) with robotic-specific, semantic, topological, and geometrical information. Models for common indoor structures (such as walls, doors, corridors, elevators, etc.) are introduced. The architectural principles support composition with additional domain and application specific knowledge. As an example, a model for an area is introduced and it is explained how this can be used in navigation. A key advantages of the proposed graph-based map representation is that it allows seamless transitions between maps, e.g., indoor and outdoor maps by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the graphs. Finally, the compatibility of the approach with existing, grid-based motion planning algorithms is shown.}
